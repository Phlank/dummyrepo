I got married over the summer and went to Utah a bit later to meet my wife's extended family. Besides that, I got a promotion and I'm working full time now.

I really didn't do a ton this summer, but i took it as a point to relax. Other than that i took a single summer class here at ball state. and i went on vacation to Las Vegas towards the end of the summer.
